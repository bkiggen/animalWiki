          <p>With more then 3,000 species of snakes in the world there is plenty to learn about them. Even though they all have many unique characteristics about them, there are quite a few similarities. Those are what lumps them all into the same type of category of living creature.</p>
          <p>They are able to live in a wide spectrum of habitats. They can live in trees or in water. Many live on land and they also can burrow. All snakes are carnivores which means they eat other living things. Not all of them make venom though while people often think that they do. They all feature a tongue that is forked which allows them to pick up scent all around them.</p>
          <p>They all have many vertebrae and ribs that they use for movement. This helps them to get around since they don’t have any limbs. They also don’t have external ears or eyelids. They rely on vibration to help them find out what is around them. They also use what vision they have combined with smell to find out about dangers.</p>
          <p>Most species of snakes aren’t aggressive at all but they have a terrible reputation about them being out to attack humans. They will usually retreat from any forms of danger that they may detect around them. However, if they start to feel like they are in trouble they will strike in order to protect themselves.</p>
